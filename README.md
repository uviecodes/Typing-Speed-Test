\# Typing Speed Test Software (Python Project)



\## Introduction

This is a basic Python project developed to check typing skills. It helps users know how fast and accurately they can type a given sentence. It is a simple console-based program suitable for beginners who are learning Python.



\## Project Overview

The program shows a predefined sentence. The user has to type the sentence as fast as possible. After typing, the program calculates and displays:

\- Time taken to type

\- Typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)

\- Accuracy of typed text compared with the original one



This project helped me learn about using timers, string comparison, loops, and input handling in Python.



\## Features

\- Displays a sentence for the user to type

\- Measures time taken automatically

\- Calculates typing speed (WPM)

\- Shows accuracy based on correct characters typed

\- Very simple and less than 30 lines of code

\- Good beginner-level programming practice



\## Technologies Used

\- Programming Language: Python

\- Built-in Library: `time`



\## How to Run the Program

1\. Install Python 3 on your system

2\. Save the given code as:

&nbsp;       Typing\_test.py

&nbsp;  3. Open Command Prompt / Terminal in the file location

4\. Run the following command:

Python typing\_test.py

5\. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen and start typing



\## Conclusion

This typing speed test program is a small but effective project to understand basic Python concepts. It helped me improve both my coding skills and knowledge of how time and string operations work in Python. I may enhance the project in the future with a better interface and more sentences to practice typing.
