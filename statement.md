## Problem Statement

Many individuals want to improve their typing speed and accuracy but lack easy-to-access tools for self-assessment. Existing solutions can be complex or require installation of extra software, making them less practical for quick evaluations. This project targets the need for a simple, command-line based typing speed test, providing instant feedback on performance.

## Scope of the Project

The project focuses on a minimal, console-based Python tool for measuring typing speed and accuracy using a fixed sentence. It calculates the time taken, words per minute (WPM), and character-level accuracy, displaying these metrics immediately. Advanced features such as data storage, user profiles, or random sentence generation are out of scope for this version.

## Target Users

•Students and self-learners who need to check and track their typing skills for studies or coding.

•Beginner programmers learning Python and basic input/output operations.

•Educators seeking a quick evaluation tool for assessments.

•Anyone interested in measuring and improving typing proficiency.

## High-level Features

•Fixed sample sentence for testing.

•Measures elapsed time between typing start and finish.

•Calculates words per minute and accuracy percentage.

•Displays instant feedback to help identify areas for improvement.


•Simple command-line interface for maximum accessibility.
